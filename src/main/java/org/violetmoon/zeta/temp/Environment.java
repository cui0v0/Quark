 * Applied to declare that the annotated element is present only in the specified environment.

 * <p>Use with caution, as Fabric-loader will remove the annotated element in a mismatched environment!</p>
 *
 * <p>When the annotated element is removed, bytecode associated with the element will not be removed.
 * For example, if a field is removed, its initializer code will not, and will cause an error on execution.</p>
 *
 * <p>If an overriding method has this annotation and its overridden method doesn't,
 * unexpected behavior may happen. If an overridden method has this annotation
 * while the overriding method doesn't, it is safe, but the method can be used from
 * the overridden class only in the specified environment.</p>
